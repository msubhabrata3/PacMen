<h2>Project Title</h2>
PacMen Game

<b>Description of Project</b>
<br>Embark on a thrilling journey through the world of JavaScript with Pacmen Fun Project! Created as part of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Fullstack Development with MERN, this project intends to bring the nostalgia of the classic arcade game Pac-Man with the excitement of coding in JavaScript.

In this project, I wanted to showcase the fundamentals of JavaScript programming while building a fun and interactive Pac-Man game from scratch. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced coder seeking a creative challenge, Pacmen Fun Project offers something for everyone.
Currently this game is at very premitive stage but as I am going to implement Pac-Man's iconic movement mechanics, including navigating mazes, eating pellets, and avoiding ghosts.

<b>How to Run:</b> 
1. Clone this project to your local and open index.html in a browser
2. Click "Add PacMan" to add 1 PacMan to the canvas
3. Click "Start Game" to see how each PacMan is moving on the canvas

<b>Roadmap of future improvements:</b>
This is just the beginning of creating a real PacMen game. I will enhance this further to look like an entertaining game.
